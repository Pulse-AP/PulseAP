## Phase 1 - Test Net

### Core (in progress)

**Description**: Create the core functions for communications, encryption systems with ability to swap protocols and define the packet structure.

- [ ] Encryption [Encryption Discussion](Encryption_Discussion.md)
	- [ ] Modularity using base class and use a factory to decide which to use.
		- [ ] AES-512
		- [ ] Kyber
		- [ ] Key Generation 
			- [ ] Storage - PEM File
		- [ ] Cold Wallet
		- [ ] Hot Wallet
- [ ] Communication [Communication Discussion](Communication_Discussion.md)
	- [ ] Packet structure
		- [ ] Packet Handler
		- [ ] Packet Generator
	- [ ] Abstract Communication / Communication Factory
		- [ ] IP Communication
			- [ ] TCP - Validators
			- [ ] UDP - Partners and Clients

### Validators

**Description**: Define the validator role and establish inter-validator communication protocols, as well as how validators interact with other user types.

	- [ ] handle network response
- [ ] Connect with partner
	- [ ] Known partner - TCP
	- [ ] Independent Partner - UDP
		- [ ] packet numbering

---

### Stress Test

Description: Stress the system on a local network and add tests that make each user type malicious to see if they get caught.

- [ ] Intra-network setup
	- [ ] Identify private IPs as well as their roles
- [ ] Need to create metrics for system performance
	- [ ] CPU
	- [ ] Storage
	- [ ] Network throughput

---

### Public Test

Description: Set the validators live on the global network, creating a filter for specific users to interact. Create logs for real time debugging.

- [ ] Bare metal or using a provider for Validator?
	- [ ] What hardware is needed?
- [ ] Set max accounts to 10k
- [ ] Need a reporting location (network / storage location)
	- [ ] logs
	- [ ] performance metrics
	- [ ] storage time
- [ ] Security audit
	- [ ] Encrypted data is encrypted
	- [ ] Signatures can only come from the key holder
	- [ ] double spend attack



---

### Co-Chains

Description: Implement the pages and Auction house co-chains and test those on the test net to see how content is being sent on chain.

- [ ] Auction House
	- [ ] Define bidding
	- [ ] Define quick swap
	- [ ] Define Digital Asset Creation
- [ ] Pages
	- [ ] Define how a page is made
	- [ ] Define how a page is shared by partners
		- [ ] Sharded
		- [ ] data acquisition (external data)
			- [ ] SQeeL
			- [ ] File / CSV in a set location
	- [ ] Rating system
	- [ ] Define AdCoin
		- [ ] Set token supply to 444 trillion
		- [ ] Make system that allows other chains to use this token. Protocol

---

### Interface

Description: Implement the graphical user interface to allow standard users the ability to interact with the chain using M3L and GSS. 

M3L should be thought of like the structure / skeleton of the page while GSS is the style / skin of that page.

### Public

Description: Allow more users to access the test net to stress test the system and see how much storage is needed for receipts.

- [ ] Release account limit to 100k
- [ ] Log bottlenecks and issues / errors
	- [ ] Do we start implementing the Code ledger protocol?
