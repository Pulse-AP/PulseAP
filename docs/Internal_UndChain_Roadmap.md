# Internal Roadmap

This internal roadmap should correlate with the global roadmap. I assume that during the creation of our internal roadmap we may find things that we may have missed / forgot to call out on the global so some refactoring may need to be done at a later time. 

I think I am going to make these check marks, so that as we go we can check off what has been accomplished. Within each section we will have a discussion file, so that if there are questions we will post it there for anyone to view. *Poor mans forum.*

Development is being divided into phases. Jump to each phase below

[Phase 1](Phase_1.md) - This phase focuses on network fundamentals and testing how UndChain will operate. This phase focuses on the communication protocol and encryption schemes. **Current Phase**

[Phase 2](Phase_2.md) - This phase will focus on getting ready for main net operations, will also introduce code ledger which should make all this documentation / communication easier and make voting and perception scores real.

[Phase 3](Phase_3.md) - This phase will finalize Pseudo so anyone can write a co-chain on their own. Also be introducing several more co-chains here, namely smack (social media protocol), Player2 (live decentralized gaming), SQeeL (decentralized database management), Mimic (decentralized AI systems) and the fourth protocol token.

[Phase 4](Phase_4.md) - The final phase will be more focused on creating hardware solutions for devices to run on UndChain. Will be releasing standard schematics on chain that will allow companies to make this hardware along with the firmware to make it work.
