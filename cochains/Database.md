# Pulse.Database

This is from the core whitepaper and should be used as a starting point for the real whitepaper.

---

Pulse.Database (formally SQeeL) is Pulse’s decentralized SQL database system, designed to create and manage on-chain databases with seamless scalability, robust user features, and enhanced developer tools. Built to balance power and usability, SQeeL transforms decentralized database management into a streamlined, interactive experience.

#### Key Features

1. **Intuitive Spreadsheet-Like Interface**
    
    - SQeeL offers a familiar, spreadsheet-inspired interface for visual data interaction, editing, and querying. This reduces the learning curve for non-technical users while still supporting advanced SQL queries for developers.
    - Users can write raw SQL queries or interact with tables visually, similar to Excel or Google Sheets.
    - The UI includes dynamic graphing tools (e.g., bar charts, line graphs, heatmaps), allowing users to visualize data instantly.
2. **Dynamic AI Assistance (Powered by Mimic)**
    
    - **Query Optimization**: Mimic suggests optimizations, flags inefficient queries, and recommends schema changes for better performance.
    - **Graph Insights**: Mimic analyzes graph data to highlight trends, anomalies, and usage patterns.
    - **Interactive Tutorials**: Mimic provides interactive tutorials on features, query writing, and best practices, helping both beginners and experienced developers.
3. **Cross-Chain Data Linking**
    
    - SQeeL enables seamless integration with other Modulr co-chains, enriching datasets without duplication.
    - Example: Pull user profiles from Smack, transaction data from the Auction House, or content metadata from Pages.
4. **Real-Time Collaboration**
    
    - Teams can collaborate on databases in real-time with permission-based access control.
    - Integration with Live allows screen sharing for pair programming, code reviews, or troubleshooting.
5. **Snapshot System and Audit Logs**
    
    - **Snapshots**: Create immutable “snapshots” of databases for backup, versioning, or archival purposes. These snapshots are stored as digital assets and can be restored on demand.
    - **Audit Logs**: Every change (e.g., row insertion, update, or deletion) is immutably logged on-chain for full transparency and compliance.
6. **Decentralized Data Storage**
    
    - SQeeL integrates natively with Modulr’s decentralized storage providers for scalable, secure, and redundant storage of large datasets.
7. **Data Monetization Marketplace**
    
    - Public or private datasets can be monetized as digital assets through Modulr’s marketplace.
    - Subscription models or pay-per-query access unlock valuable datasets for researchers, businesses, and developers.
8. **Module Marketplace**
    
    - A marketplace for reusable database modules lets developers integrate pre-built systems. Modules are categorized, monetized as digital assets, and can be recommended via Mimic.
    - Example: Developers building a video library can import modules for content tagging, search functions, or user interaction systems.
9. **Forking and Licensing**
    
    - SQeeL respects Modulr’s digital asset contracts to ensure proper licensing and monetization.
    - Databases or modules can be forked for customization while adhering to the creator’s licensing terms.
10. **Clone Protocol for External Data Integration**
    
    - The Clone Protocol allows users to ingest external datasets from traditional Web2 or Web3 systems onto the blockchain.
    - Users can point the protocol to existing datasets (e.g., CSVs, APIs, or public datasets), enabling seamless integration and utilization.

#### Why SQeeL?

SQeeL revolutionizes decentralized database management by combining powerful SQL capabilities with a visual, user-friendly interface and AI-driven assistance. With tools for collaboration, monetization, and integration across co-chains, SQeeL provides a seamless experience for developers, creators, and enterprises alike.

Whether building public datasets, private repositories, or interactive applications, SQeeL empowers you to store, visualize, and manage data effectively on Pulse.
