# Pulse.Social

This is from the core whitepaper and should be used as a starting point for the dedicated whitepaper on social.

Pulse.Social (formally SMACK) redefines decentralized messaging and social interaction, offering a robust protocol for communication, community building, and content ownership. Smack is not a social media system but rather a **protocol** that enables platforms and creators to build decentralized applications and networks tailored to their needs.

#### Key Features

**1. Decentralized Messaging and Social Interaction**

- Supports direct messaging, group creation, and forum-style discussions.
- Enables scalable social networks, offering both private and public content-sharing options.
- **Interactive Features**:
    - Users can interact with posts using reactions (e.g., likes, dislikes, and emojis).
    - Content can be shared with other users or groups, encouraging collaboration and dissemination.
    - Comment systems allow for threaded discussions and dynamic interactions.

**2. Profile Portability and Ownership**

- Profiles and content are tied to the user, not the platform. If removed from one curator’s system (e.g., Facebook or X), users retain their content, connections, and digital presence across other systems.

**3. Curators and Keepers**

- **Curators**: Platforms that publish user content, acting as hubs for interaction and visibility.
- **Keepers**: Content creators who maintain full ownership of their works, enabling them to control distribution and monetize their content.
    - Keepers can allow curators to post their content or enter exclusive agreements for monetization.

**4. Content Propagation and Promotion**

- **Vanilla Smack** includes a basic system for propagating and promoting content using factors like:
    - **Content Type**: Prioritizing text, video, or images based on user preferences.
    - **Current Events**: Highlighting trending topics or local news.
    - **Creator Popularity**: Amplifying content from creators with a strong reputation.
    - **Engagement Metrics**: Factoring in likes, reactions, and shares.
    - **Time Spent Viewing**: Boosting content that retains user attention.
- Users can customize their feed preferences, enabling or disabling specific content types and controlling their viewing experience.
- Transparency: Users can discover why specific content appears in their feed.
- **Curator Override**: Platforms can implement their own curation systems to replace or augment Smack’s default propagation behavior, offering tailored content promotion strategies.

**5. Monetization Opportunities**

- Users can monetize content directly using Modulr’s native tokens (e.g., USP or AdCoin).
- Supports subscription-based models, tipping systems, and ad revenue sharing to reward creators.

**6. Integration with Pages and M3L/GSS**

- Leverages the Pages co-chain for hosting user-generated content like blogs, forums, and community hubs.
- Uses M3L and GSS for adaptive layouts, ensuring accessibility across devices and input methods.

**7. Mimic Integration for Personalized Experience**

- Mimic AI enhances the platform’s experience by curating personalized feeds, suggesting content, and providing real-time translation for multilingual interactions.
- **Important Note**: Mimic can be implemented by creators or platforms (curators) to moderate content or provide insights. **Smack itself does not moderate content**, as it is strictly a protocol, not a centralized system.

**8. Privacy and Security**

- Messages **can** be encrypted end-to-end, depending on the service (curator) the user interacts with.
    - Example: Direct messages or private group chats can be encrypted, while public posts (e.g., akin to X tweets) are not encrypted since they are intended to be publicly visible.
- Implements zero-knowledge proofs for user verification without exposing personal information.

**9. Page's Age Verification System**

- Smack integrates with the **Page’s age verification system**, enabling platforms to enforce age restrictions. This feature supports compliance with local regulations restricting underage access to social media while ensuring privacy. Platforms can choose whether to allow underage users to participate, fostering safer digital spaces.

**10. Data Portability and Compliance**

- Users can export their content and connections in a standardized format, ensuring full data portability.
- Aligns with global privacy regulations to offer compliance-friendly solutions for enterprises and individuals.

**11. Dynamic Content Scaling**

- Uses Modulr’s dynamic spread protocol to scale content delivery based on demand and region, ensuring smooth interaction even during high traffic.

#### Why Smack?

Smack empowers creators (keepers) and platforms (curators) to build decentralized networks and social ecosystems while respecting user ownership and privacy. Its flexibility allows for seamless integration into applications, enabling unique monetization and interaction models.

With tools for personalized content discovery, transparent propagation, and adaptive moderation, Smack creates a fair, user-centric ecosystem. It is the foundation for enabling the next generation of decentralized social applications where users and creators truly own their digital presence.
