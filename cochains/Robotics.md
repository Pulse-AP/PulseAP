# Pulse.Robotics

This whitepaper is still in progress and will go into detail regarding how our robotics co-chain (our first major product will function). Below is what was inside our core whitepaper so I can use this as a starting point.

Pusle.Robotics (formally LINK) is Pulse’s **standardized protocol for remote robotics**, designed to make piloting physical systems as seamless as accessing an app. Whether operating a humanoid surrogate, flying a drone, or steering an autonomous mower, LINK provides the ultra-responsive foundation for decentralized embodiment.

By creating a shared communication and control standard, LINK ensures secure, modular, and low-latency access to machines within a user's region, while enabling global coordination and oversight through AI-assisted supervision across Modulr subdomains.

**Key Features:**

1. **Unified Piloting Protocol**
    
    - LINK serves as a **hardware-agnostic communication layer** that can be implemented by any robot, drone, or control station. It standardizes how movement, vision, and feedback are encoded, ensuring interoperability across devices and vendors.
    - Devices that support LINK can be driven manually, supervised by AI, or operated collaboratively—**enabling both real-time embodiment and semi-autonomous delegation.**
        
2. **Ultra-Low Latency Pipeline**
    
    - LINK is engineered to support **sub-12ms motion-to-action latency**, making it suitable for everything from tactile robotics to competitive drone piloting.
        
    - Its architecture includes:
        - 360° visual systems for head-tracked VR environments
        - UDP-based data channels for rapid control & feedback
        - Timestamped motion frames for consistent state prediction
            
3. **Augmented Reality (AR) Guidance**
    
    - In **AR Mode**, LINK overlays spatial highlights to visualize interactable objects and predicted AI behavior.
    - This is especially powerful in **Supervisor Mode**, where a user can observe the robot’s intended actions and intervene before errors occur—turning the user into a proactive guide rather than a passive viewer.
        
4. **Phantom Mode (Simulated Embodiment Layer)**
    
    - For environments with limited bandwidth or unpredictable input, LINK supports a **simulated piloting mode** where the world is mirrored into a lightweight, game-like 3D space.
    - Instead of streaming high-bandwidth video, the user interacts with **preloaded 3D assets and sensor inputs**—dramatically reducing network load while enhancing control speed.
    - This mode also enables **gamified task execution**, useful for training, coordination, or user-friendly job interfaces.
        
5. **Access by Design**
    
    - LINK was built to **embody Modulr’s “Access” layer**: the ability to control, touch, and affect the real world through secure, decentralized systems.
    - From robots in homes and farms to machines in factories and cities, LINK ensures users can connect, control, and coordinate without centralized gateways or proprietary lock-in.
        
6. **Mimic Synergy**
    
    - LINK integrates tightly with the Mimic co-chain for **supervised automation and AI-directed operation**.
    - Mimic will:
        - Handle low-level motion planning
        - Auto-suggest next actions
        - Monitor operator behavior for safety and efficiency
        - Swap users between “Full Pilot” and “Supervisor” roles on the fly
            
7. **Future-Proof Modularity**
    
    - LINK is designed for easy extension into:
        - **Fleet Management** for enterprise-scale deployments
        - **AI-Driven Swarms** for coordinated task execution
        - **Permissioned Control Leasing**, where users rent LINK-compatible bots across networks
        - **On-chain action verification** via zk-motion logs and validator-signed events

**Use Cases and Potential:**

- **Remote Farming & Equipment Control**  
    Use LINK-enabled rigs to remotely operate tractors, pickers, and autonomous harvesters—with AR assistance and fallback Phantom Mode for unreliable network zones.
    
- **Surrogate Robotics for Home & Care**  
    Allow users to step into LINK-compatible home bots to check on loved ones, assist with tasks, or provide companionship—controlled securely and respectfully.
    
- **Logistics & Infrastructure Maintenance**  
    LINK offers a standardized framework for inspecting, repairing, or managing distributed systems such as pipelines, bridges, or transport hubs.
    
- **Security & Surveillance**  
    Coordinate robotic patrols or autonomous drones with override-ready Supervisor Mode, reducing risk while maintaining accountability.
    
- **Immersive Control & Gamified Workflows**  
    Train operators through Phantom Mode. Gamify real-world tasks. Reduce fatigue by turning repetitive operations into engaging digital interactions.

**In Summary**

LINK makes it possible to **pilot and coordinate physical machines** through a unified, decentralized control layer. Within a user’s local region, LINK offers **real-time, low-latency embodiment**—while globally, users can guide AI-driven systems through **Supervisor Mode** or interact via a lightweight simulation in **Phantom Mode**.

It’s more than a protocol—it’s how **Access becomes physical** on Pulse.
